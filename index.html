      <p>
        Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin Jr. KBE (16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977)
        was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in
        the era of silent film.

      He became a worldwide icon through his screen persona, the Tramp, and is
      considered one of the film industry's most important figures. His career
      spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a
      year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and
      controversy. Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and
      hardship. His father was absent and his mother struggled financially - he
      was sent to a workhouse twice before age nine.

          When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin
          began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later
          working as a stage actor and comedian.

          At 19, he was signed to the Fred Karno company, which took him to the
          United States.

          He was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for
          Keystone Studios. He soon developed the Tramp persona and attracted a
          large fan base.

          directed his own films and continued to hone his craft as he moved to
          the Essanay, Mutual, and First National corporations. By 1918, he was
          one of the world's best-known figures.

          which gave him complete control over his films.

          His first sound film was The Great Dictator (1940), which satirised
          Adolf Hitler. The 1940s were marked with controversy for Chaplin, and
          his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of communist
          sympathies, and some members of the press and public were scandalized
          by his involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger
          women. An FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to
          leave the U.S. and settle in Switzerland.

        Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the
        music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial
        independence enabled him to spend years on the development and
        production of a picture. His films are characterised by slapstick
        combined with pathos, typified in the Tramp's struggles against
        adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well as
        autobiographical elements. He received an Honorary Academy Award for
        "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art
        form of this century" in 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his
        work. He continues to be held in high regard, with The Gold Rush, City
        Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator often ranked on lists of
        the greatest films of all time. for more information

        here you can see some of his quotes: <br />

        “As I began to love myself I found that anguish and emotional suffering
        are only warning signs that I was living against my own truth. Today, I
        know, this is “AUTHENTICITY”. <br />
        “We think too much and feel too little.” <br />
        “You'll find that life is still worthwhile, if you just smile.” <br />
        “Your naked body should only belong to those who fall in love with your
        naked soul.” <br />
        “My pain may be the reason for somebody's laugh. But my laugh must never
        be the reason for somebody's pain.”<br />
        “Failure is unimportant. It takes courage to make a fool of yourself”<br />
        “To truly laugh, you must be able to take your pain, and play with
        it.”<br />
        “Life is a tragedy when seen in close-up, but a comedy in long-shot.”<br />
        “Imagination means nothing without doing.”<br />
        “Perfect love is the most beautiful of all frustrations because it is
        more than one can express.”<br />
